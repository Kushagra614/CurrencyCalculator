**Currency Converter**

This C++ program is a simple and user-friendly currency converter that allows you to convert between various currencies:

    * Rupee to Dollar
    * Dollar to Rupee
    * Rupee to Euro
    * Euro to Rupee
    * Dollar to Euro
    * Euro to Dollar
* Clear and concise user interface
* Repeatable calculations until you exit

**Usage:**

1. **Compile:** Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the source code (`currency_converter.cpp`):

   ```bash
   g++ currency_converter.cpp -o currency_converter
   ```

2. **Run:** Execute the compiled program (`currency_converter`):

   ```bash
   ./currency_converter
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   * Choose the conversion you want (1-6).
   * Enter the amount you want to convert.
   * The program will display the converted amount.
   * To use the calculator again, enter "yes" or any other character when prompted. Enter "no" to exit.

**Note:**

* The currency conversion rates used in this program are for illustrative purposes only and may not reflect real-time exchange rates.

**Further Enhancements (Optional):**

* Implement functions to update currency exchange rates based on external sources (e.g., APIs).
* Add support for additional currencies.
* Improve error handling for invalid user input.
* Create a more visually appealing user interface using libraries like ncurses or a graphical toolkit.

I hope this README provides a comprehensive overview of your currency converter!
